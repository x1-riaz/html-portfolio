    <p>Delicious no-bake oatmeal bars with a chocolaty peanut butter layer. I made about 100 dozen cookies for the holidays, and these were everyone's favorite!</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>

    <ul>
        <li>1 cup butter</li>
        <li>½ cup packed brown sugar</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
        <li>3 cups quick cooking oats</li>
        <li>1 cup semisweet chocolate chips</li>
        <li>½ cup peanut butter</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Directions</h2>

    <ol>
        <li>Grease a 9-inch square pan.
        </li>

        <li>Melt butter in a large saucepan over medium heat. Stir in brown sugar and vanilla; mix in oats. Cook over low heat until ingredients are well blended, about 2 to 3 minutes.
        </li>

        <li>Press 1/2 of the mixture into the bottom of the prepared pan. Reserve remaining oat mixture for topping.</li>

        <li>Meanwhile, melt chocolate chips and peanut butter in a small heavy saucepan over low heat, stirring frequently until smooth. Pour chocolate mixture over crust in the pan and spread evenly with a knife or the back of a spoon.</li>
        
        <li>Crumble remaining oat mixture over chocolate layer, pressing down gently. Cover and refrigerate for 2 to 3 hours or overnight. Bring to room temperature before cutting into bars.</li>
